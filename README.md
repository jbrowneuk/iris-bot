# iris-bot
Discord version of my slack chatbot, rewritten from the ground up

// TODO make readme better

## Getting up and running 
1. Install Node. The LTS version should be fine. 
2. `npm run quickstart` fetches dependencies, builds and then runs the bot using the start entry point.
 
# Developing 
1. `npm run develop` spins up a live-reload instance of the bot. Every time you change a file and save it, the bot will restart with the latest changes
